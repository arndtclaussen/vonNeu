Lets have some internal fun. Why not.

# Initial Python setup (SOP)

We create a new environment. 
We are using the name *env*, because it is already in the .gitignore.
```
python3 -m venv env
```
Create a requirements.txt file by simply
```
touch requirements.txt
```
And then we activate the environment
```
source env/bin/activate
```
Maybe we need to update pip other wise we can install the requirements.
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
